"""Drain the account-mail outbox.

**One row per transaction.** This is the whole design note. Claiming a
batch inside a single transaction is the obvious implementation and it
loses mail: a failure on row N rolls back the already-recorded sends of
rows 1..N-1, so those messages are gone from the database but not from
the recipients' inboxes, and the next poll sends them again. That bug
was found and fixed in marketing-service; it is not being re-introduced
here, where a duplicate means a second live password-reset link.

The other half of the shape: because the outbox is RLS-scoped and this
loop has no tenant of its own, it asks the unscoped writer pool which
tenants have due mail and then opens a properly scoped connection per
tenant. The alternative — granting the worker a pool that bypasses RLS —
would put a permanent hole in the tenancy boundary for the sake of a
background job.
