"""S21 notification emission — the MFA reminder.

auth-service's first producer, and it exists because auth-service is the
only service that knows an account has no second factor.

The reminder has two halves and this module is the smaller one:

  · STANDING — the `mfa_reminders` row, returned by ``GET /auth/me`` and
    rendered as a banner the user cannot dismiss. It is what makes the
    reminder last "until they set it".
  · ARRIVING — this event: the bell, and an email, because a user with no
    second factor is very often a user who signs in rarely, and a banner
    only reminds someone who is already looking at the app.

Fire-and-forget, like every other producer in the estate (ADR-0029):
``publish_event`` swallows its own failures and the caller does not wait
on fan-out. A reminder must not fail to be RECORDED because the
notification bus is down — the row is the durable half, and the endpoint
returns 201 either way.

Personal data: none is reachable from here. The payload carries the requester's
ROLE (a closed vocabulary), never their name, and a count. See the
allow-list in notification-service's `domain/render.py`.
