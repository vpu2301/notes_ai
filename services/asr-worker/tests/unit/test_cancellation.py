"""Cancelling a job that is already running.

``DELETE /asr/jobs/{id}`` on a RUNNING job cannot stop anything by itself:
asr-service sets ``cancel_requested`` and leaves the status alone. Acting on
it is the worker's job, and before this it only ever looked twice — once
before claiming the message, once after decoding the audio. Anything
cancelled after inference started ran to completion and came back
``complete``, so from the user's side the Cancel button did nothing.

These cover the two checkpoints that were missing: between inference chunks,
and the last look before a transcript becomes a fact.
