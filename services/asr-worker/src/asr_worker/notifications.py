"""Sprint-12 notification emission for batch transcription jobs.

A batch job is the strongest case in the system for a notification: it
runs for minutes with nobody watching, and until now its only terminal
signal was a status column the user had to go and poll.

Fire-and-forget, like every other producer: `publish_event` swallows its
own failures and the worker does not await fan-out. A transcription must
not be marked failed because the notification bus is down (ADR-0029).
