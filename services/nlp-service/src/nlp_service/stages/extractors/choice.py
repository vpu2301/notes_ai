"""choice / multi_choice extraction.

**Prime directive: the extractor proposes, the user confirms.**
Below threshold, ambiguous, or negated ⇒ NO selection. An empty field
with the prose preserved is always correct; a wrong auto-filled
field is not.

Pure functions — no I/O, no clock, no randomness, injected thresholds.
Every decision here is replayable byte-for-byte, which is why the
edit-distance implementation is local (below) rather than a library
call: a dependency upgrade that changed edit-distance edge semantics
would silently alter historical replays under a frozen
``pipeline_version``.

Matching, per option, per candidate phrase (its label + each alias):

1. Tokenize text and phrase identically (NFC, lower, split on
   non-alphanumerics, apostrophes folded).
2. Slide the phrase over the text tokens. A phrase matches at a
   position when EVERY phrase token is within Levenshtein 1 of the
   aligned text token — and tokens of ≤ 3 characters must match
   EXACTLY (the short-token guard; without it "не" fuzzy-matches "ні"
   and "на", which would invert the meaning of a Ukrainian
   statement).
3. A negator in the 2 tokens before the match blocks it, unless the
   negator is part of the matched phrase itself (aliases like
   "не підписаний" legitimately contain one).
4. Confidence = token tightness (1 − Σdistance/Σlength), weighted so a
   longer phrase match outranks a single-token one; an exact
   full-phrase match scores 1.0.
