"""numeric_with_unit / date binders.

These are **binders, not parsers**. They pick from the artifacts the
normalizer stages reported about their own output; they
contain no numeral vocabulary, no unit table and no date arithmetic of
their own. That is the single-source rule: if a binder re-derived
"сто сорок" → 140 or resolved "три дні тому", it would drift from the
normalizer the first time either changed.

The choice-extractor ambiguity rule applies unchanged: several candidates
and no way to choose ⇒ empty field, prose preserved.
