"""Stage 1 — voice command detection.

The stage delegates to :class:`VoiceCommandMatcher`. Detected matches
are converted to :class:`CommandSlot` (for inspectability) + the
matching words are flagged ``is_voice_command_token=True`` so later
stages (punctuation, numbers, abbreviations) skip them.

Mixed-content splitting: a command in the middle of a segment doesn't
split the segment into multiple records — instead, the words remain a
single list with the command tokens flagged. Downstream renderers can
split if they want, but the pipeline's text/words invariant stays
clean.
