"""GET /reports/{id}/pdf — server-rendered PDF (M1·A3 + draft export).

Renders the current version of a report as a PDF. Non-signed reports
(draft / finalized / amended) are rendered with a visible DRAFT treatment
(watermark + banner + "no legal force" disclaimer) so an unsigned export
is never mistaken for a legally-binding document. Only a *cancelled*
report is refused (409); a signed report can be exported "clean" via
``?variant=clean``. The weasyprint import lives behind ``domain.pdf`` so
it never loads on the router import path.
