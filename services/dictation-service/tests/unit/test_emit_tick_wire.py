"""``_emit_tick`` must actually serialize a windower tick onto the wire.

Regression for the defect found by running conversation mode end-to-end
against the deployed stack (sprint 14): the handler passed the
windower's ``asr_models.WordTiming`` objects straight into the protocol
models' ``words`` field, which is typed ``list[TokenTiming]``. The two
are field-identical but are DIFFERENT classes, and pydantic v2 does not
coerce one BaseModel instance into another — so constructing the
``Partial``/``PartialV2`` raised ``ValidationError``.

That exception escaped ``_emit_tick`` into ``_window_loop``, which ran
as a bare ``create_task`` with no error path: the window loop died on
the very FIRST partial of every session, in both protocol versions.
The session kept accepting audio, kept looking healthy, stored its
audio — and finalized an empty transcript. Nothing was logged.

So these tests assert two things that together make that failure
impossible to reintroduce silently:
  1. a tick carrying real ``WordTiming``s serializes for v1 AND v2;
  2. a tick that raises does not kill the loop, and repeated failures
     fail the session loudly instead of transcribing nothing.
