"""Token alignment between consecutive overlapping windows.

Whisper's output for the overlap region (sprint 04: 2 s) is not
deterministic across calls — different windowing can produce slightly
different tokenisation, especially across word boundaries. The aligner
chooses the higher-probability transcription for each aligned word and
emits a 'boundary uncertainty' signal when the two transcriptions
disagree substantially.

The alignment is plain Levenshtein on word tokens; the input volumes
(≤ 50 words per overlap) make the O(N×M) cost negligible.
