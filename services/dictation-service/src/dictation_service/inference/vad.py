"""Energy-based VAD over the sliding buffer.

The streaming committer needs a silence-boundary signal to know when
it's safe to graduate a word from PARTIAL to FINAL. We don't want to
spin up the Silero model per window (latency + memory); a cheap
short-term energy threshold is good enough for boundary detection.

For higher-quality VAD on the full session (sprint 14 diarization), we
fall back to the asr-worker's Silero wrapper.
