"""Sliding-window orchestrator for streaming Whisper.

Per-window flow (called every ``window_tick_interval_ms``):

1. If less than ``min_window_for_partial_seconds`` of fresh audio →
   no-op.
2. Otherwise, slice ``[cursor − overlap_s, cursor + window_s)`` from
   the session buffer.
3. Submit to the inference queue.
4. Run :func:`align_overlap` between the new window's overlap region
   and the previous window's overlap region. Pick higher-probability
   tokens per aligned pair.
5. Apply commitment policy: words older than one full window + with a
   silence boundary after them + with no_speech_prob ≤ threshold → FINAL.
6. Return :class:`TickOutput` with partials, finals, and warnings; the
   session loop sends them on the wire.

The windower is stateful per-session; one instance lives in each
:class:`SessionContext`.

        The commit rules deliberately hold a word back until it is past the

        mid-session, but at end-of-session there is no next window to revise
        anything and no further audio to produce a boundary — so the words
        still held are simply dropped, and `finalize` persists a transcript
        that stops short of what was actually said.

        The loss is one commit-horizon's worth of speech (the trailing
        ``overlap_s``) on EVERY session, which is also why it went unnoticed:
        at the 2 s default it looks like a clipped last word rather than a
        bug. It scales with the overlap, so any deployment that widens the
        window to buy throughput would lose proportionally more.
