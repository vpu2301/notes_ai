"""Sprint-12 notification emission for streaming dictation sessions.

Sits beside the WS handler rather than inside `session/finalize.py`.
`finalize_session` is the shared end-of-life routine for every terminal
reason — including `worker_failure` and the abandon timer — and a
session that died is not a session the user wants congratulated on
completing. The handler knows which of those it is; the finalizer does
not.

Fire-and-forget, exactly like note-service's equivalent:
`publish_event` swallows its own failures and the caller does not wait
on fan-out. A dictation must not fail to finalize because the
notification bus is down (ADR-0029).
