"""Stale-session reaper.

The abandon timer that retires an idle session (``_abandon_after_idle`` in
``ws/handler.py``) is an ``asyncio`` task inside the worker that owns the
session. That works for every graceful path and for none of the ungraceful
ones: kill the worker and its timers die with it, leaving every session it
held parked in ``active`` / ``paused`` / ``reconnecting`` **forever**. Those
rows are not cosmetic — ``count_active_for_tenant`` gates
``per_tenant_max_active_sessions``, so each stranded row permanently burns a
slot in the tenant's capacity budget, and each one keeps showing up in the
user's "still recording" list.

The reaper is the out-of-process backstop. Its single safety interlock is
the worker heartbeat in Redis: a session is collected **only** when the
worker named on the row has stopped heart-beating. A session paused for an
hour on a healthy worker is a candidate every sweep and is never collected.

Cross-tenant enumeration goes through the ``dictation_tenants_with_stale_sessions``
SECURITY DEFINER function (0059) — the sanctioned pattern from 0051/0036 —
and every row read and write still happens inside ``tenant_connection``.
