"""Session state machine.

State graph (canonical, see docs/api/dictation-ws-v1.md § lifecycle):

    creating ──► active ──► finalized
                  │ ▲
                  ▼ │
                paused
                  │
                  ▼
              reconnecting ──► finalized | abandoned | failed
                  │
                  ▼
                 failed

Transitions are explicit. ``can_transition`` is the gate every code path
uses before mutating ``dictation_sessions.status`` so an invalid
transition fails fast instead of corrupting state.
