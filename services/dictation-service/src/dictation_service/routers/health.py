"""Liveness + readiness probes.

Readiness checks DB / Redis / GPU / Whisper-loaded — sprint 04 §1 — plus,
since sprint 14, whether this worker can actually take a CONVERSATION
session: that needs a second model (ECAPA + Silero) resident and warm.

The split matters for the fleet. A worker whose diarizer failed to load is
still a perfectly good dictation worker, so ``/readyz`` stays 200 and the
worker keeps serving — but ``conversation_ready`` goes false and the
scheduler/LB must not send conversation traffic to it. A worker that
advertised conversation capacity with a cold diarizer would pay weight
loading inside its first window and blow the latency budget.
