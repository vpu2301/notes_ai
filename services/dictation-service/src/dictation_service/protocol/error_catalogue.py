"""Stable error codes for the medical-dictation.v1 wire protocol.

These are PUBLIC. Once a frontend ships against them they're a contract:
new codes can be added, existing ones can't be renamed or repurposed.

`recoverable` indicates whether the client should attempt to recover
the session (reconnect, retransmit, restart) or treat the error as
terminal.
