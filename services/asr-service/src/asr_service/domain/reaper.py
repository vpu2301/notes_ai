"""Stranded-job reaper.

Every other terminal outcome of a batch job is written by the worker that
owns it: it decodes, it transcribes, it marks the row ``complete`` or
``failed``. That covers every path the worker survives, and none of the
ones it doesn't. Kill the worker mid-inference — SIGKILL, an OOM kill, a
node eviction — and its job stays ``running`` with nobody left to finish
the sentence. Nothing in the system ever revisits that row.

Two stranded shapes, one sweep:

``running`` past the grace window
    The worker died after claiming the job. The queue may well redeliver
    the message and a second worker may produce the transcript — that is
    exactly why the grace window is long and why the update is conditional.

``queued`` past a longer grace window
    The row committed and the enqueue returned, but the message never
    reached a worker: a flushed Redis, a trimmed stream, a consumer group
    recreated underneath it.

Both are worse than cosmetic. ``count_active_jobs`` gates
``per_tenant_concurrent_jobs``, so every stranded row permanently burns a
slot in the tenant's upload budget — enough of them and the tenant cannot
submit at all — and each one shows the user a job that will never
resolve.

The reaper lives in asr-service, not in asr-worker, for the obvious
reason: a backstop that runs inside the process being backstopped is not
a backstop. Cross-tenant enumeration goes through the
``asr_tenants_with_stale_jobs`` SECURITY DEFINER function (0077) — the
sanctioned pattern from 0059/0051/0036 — and every row read and write
still happens inside ``tenant_connection``.

The grace windows ARE the safety interlock; asr-worker publishes no
heartbeat to check against. They must stay comfortably above the worst
case the worker allows itself (``max_duration_seconds`` ×
``asr_max_inference_seconds_multiplier``, plus a redelivery or two), or
the reaper will fail jobs that were merely slow. Reaping early is not
catastrophic — the worker's idempotency check sees the terminal row on
redelivery and skips — but it does cost the user a transcript that
was on its way.
