"""Confirm/override audit signals for typed fields (sprint 13, step 06).

These two events are the extractor's quality feedback loop: how often
authors accept a proposal versus replace it. Step 08's dashboard
reads them; a rising override rate means alias coverage or the
threshold needs work — data, not intuition.

**The content line.** Payloads carry the section key, the field type,
and — only for CLOSED vocabularies — the option slug. Free-text values
are never included. The audit chain is append-only and hash-linked: a
"changed it to <prose>" payload would put unerasable personal data in
it. Enforced by tests.
