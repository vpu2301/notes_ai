"""Sprint-12 notification emission for note lifecycle transitions.

Sits at the router layer, not in `domain/note_lifecycle.py`. The state
machine is a pure function of (conn, note_id, status) and has neither
the acting user nor the note's authors in scope; emitting from there
would mean re-reading the row and threading Redis through the domain
layer, inverting `routers → domain`.

Everything here is fire-and-forget: `publish_event` swallows its own
failures, and the callers do not await fan-out. Finalizing a note must
not fail because the notification bus is down (ADR-0029).
