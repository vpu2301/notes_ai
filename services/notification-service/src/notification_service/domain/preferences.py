"""Preference + quiet-hours resolution.

Deliberately PURE: every input is a parameter, including the clock. The
whole reason a "you turned email off and still got one" bug (E8) is hard
to fix is usually that the decision is spread across three call sites
with slightly different conditions. Here there is exactly one function
that decides, it takes no ambient state, and it is exhaustively unit
tested against a frozen clock — including across a DST boundary (E9).
