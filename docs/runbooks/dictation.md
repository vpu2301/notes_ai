## Failure modes

### § transcript-is-nonsense-words

Symptom: the transcript is fluent-looking but the words do not exist in
the language — invented word-shapes instead of what the speaker said.
Reported from the conversation surface, because that is the only surface
whose text comes from this service (Studio dictation uses the browser's
Web Speech API and batch uploads go through asr-worker).

This is a MODEL problem, not a wire or diarization problem. Check first:

```bash
curl -s localhost:8002/healthz | jq .model      # or: docker compose exec dictation-service env | grep MD_ASR
```

1. **`whisper-tiny` (or `small`) is fatal for Ukrainian.** It does not
   degrade gracefully — it invents word-shapes (measured on an internal
   Ukrainian conversation fixture: tiny/int8 and small/int8 both
   produced fluent nonsense; only large-v3/int8 transcribed the actual
   words). Only large-v3 is acceptable. Anything else, repoint
   `MD_ASR_MODEL` and bounce.
2. If the model is right, check `MD_ASR_STREAMING_VAD_FILTER` is not
   `false`. With the VAD off, silence-only windows are decoded and Whisper
   emits its training attractors ("Дякую за перегляд!" / "Thanks for
   watching!") which then commit as if they were speech.
3. A nonsense run that also shows `initial_prompt` repetition is worth a
   look at the vocabulary hint: a prompt repeated inside `initial_prompt`
   drives Whisper into repetition loops.

### § transcript-stops-short-of-what-was-said

Symptom: the persisted transcript is correct but ends early — the closing
exchange of the meeting is missing.

Two independent tails, both funnelled through `_finalize_normal`:

1. **Un-windowed audio.** `next_slice` only yields a window once
   `MDX_WINDOW_MIN_FOR_PARTIAL_SECONDS` of fresh audio exists, so the
   remainder below that never reaches the model without the forced final
   window. Confirm `windower.final_drain_failed` is absent from the logs.
2. **Un-committed words.** Words inside the commit horizon
   (`MDX_WINDOW_OVERLAP_SECONDS`) are held pending a silence boundary that
   end-of-session will never produce. Confirm
   `finalize.provisional_flushed` appears for the session.

Both losses scale with those two settings, so a worker retuned for
throughput (large window/hop) loses proportionally more if either
mechanism is broken.

### § high-partial-latency

Symptom: `mdx_dictation_partial_latency_ms` p95 > 1500 ms for 5 min.

1. Check GPU utilization on the worker. If pinned, look for noisy
   neighbors (other CUDA processes).
2. Check inference-queue depth (logs: `inference.deadline_missed`).
3. If 3+ consecutive deadline misses, the queue auto-emits
   `Warning{worker_overloaded}` — reduce `MDX_PER_WORKER_MAX_SESSIONS`
   from 4 to 3 and bounce one replica.
4. If a recent model bump: roll back; re-run the synthetic streaming-latency probe.

### § stuck-reconnecting

Symptom: session sits in `reconnecting` long after client gave up.

1. SQL: `SELECT id, user_id, worker_id, last_active_at FROM dictation_sessions WHERE status='reconnecting' ORDER BY last_active_at;`.
2. Check worker liveness for `worker_id`. If TTL expired, the worker is dead — `POST /dictate/sessions/{id}/finalize` to commit what was captured.
3. Otherwise wait: the 30-minute abandon timer will fire automatically.

### § worker-crash

Symptom: `dictation-service` pod restart; `mdx_dictation_active_sessions` for that worker_id drops to 0.

1. `nvidia-smi` on the host — GPU healthy?
2. Logs: `kubectl logs ... -p` to read the prior instance's last messages.
3. Sessions bound to that worker move to `failed` (next reconnect
   attempt). Frontend offers "recover from local buffer" (sprint-03
   batch path).

### § dev-stack-oom (Docker Desktop)

Symptom: the SPA's conversation mode shows `connect_failed` and the
WebSocket never opens, while every other service looks healthy.
`docker ps` shows dictation-service perpetually `health: starting` with
a climbing `RestartCount`; its log repeats "Started server process" /
"Waiting for application startup" and never reaches "Application
startup complete".

Cause: the dev stack runs TWO whisper large-v3 CPU instances —
asr-worker (2.7 GiB) and dictation-service (3.0 GiB, model + ECAPA
diarizer) — on top of ~2 GiB of infra. Docker Desktop's default engine
memory is 8 GiB, so dictation-service is killed by the kernel partway
through loading the diarizer and `restart: unless-stopped` puts it
straight back into the same wall. Nothing is logged inside the
container: it never gets to run a shutdown handler.

Confirm from OUTSIDE the container — this is the only place the reason
is visible:

```sh
docker events --filter container=notes-ai-dictation-service-1 \
  --since 3m --until 0s
# → `oom` immediately followed by `die exit=137` on every cycle
docker info --format '{{.MemTotal}}'   # what the engine actually has
```

Fix: Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources → Memory ≥ 12 GiB, apply,
and let the stack come back up. Verify with
`docker stats --no-stream` that dictation-service settles at ~3 GiB and
`RestartCount` stays 0. Where the host cannot spare it, stop asr-worker
(`docker compose stop asr-worker`) for the duration — batch
transcription goes away, streaming and conversation keep working.

### § master-key-missing

Same as sprint-03 asr-worker §master-key-missing — service refuses to
start; security incident in prod; in dev, run:

```sh
openssl rand 32 > infra/dev/master.key
chmod 0400 infra/dev/master.key
```

### § scale-out-trigger

Symptom: `DictationWorkerWeightSaturated` — `mdx_dictation_capacity_weight_used`
has reached `mdx_dictation_capacity_weight_max` for 5 min.

**Watch weight, not headcount.** Since sprint 14 a conversation session
costs `MDX_CONVERSATION_SESSION_WEIGHT` (default 2) because it runs two
models; dictation costs 1. A worker carrying 2 conversation sessions is
FULL while `active_sessions` reads "2" — the old headcount rule
(`active_sessions >= 4`) could not fire in that state at all.

Sprint 16 wires HPA to the weight gauge. Until then: manually scale via
`docker compose up -d --scale dictation-service=N` (each replica is a
separate worker_id).

### § conversation-capacity-unavailable

Symptom: `DictationConversationCapacityUnavailable` — a worker serves
dictation (`/readyz` 200, whisper loaded) but `conversation_ready == 0`.

This is deliberate: a failed diarizer does NOT take the worker out of
rotation, because it is still a perfectly good dictation worker. But it
must not receive conversation traffic, and nothing else would notice.

```sh
curl -s localhost:8002/readyz | jq '{conversation_ready, diarizer_loaded, diarizer_error}'
```

`diarizer_error` names the cause. The two that matter:

- `ModelIntegrityError` — the startup checksum assertion refused the
  baked weights (fail-closed, docs/models/PINS.md). **Do not "fix" this
  by clearing `MDX_DIAR_MODEL_SHA256`.** The image is wrong: rebuild it,
  and treat a mismatch on a previously-good image as a supply-chain
  incident.
- missing `/opt/models/ecapa` — the image predates the sprint-14 bake.
  Rebuild from `services/dictation-service/Dockerfile{,.cpu}`.

### § device-memory-pressure

Symptom: `DictationDeviceMemoryHigh` (>90%) or `...Critical` (>97%).

Conversation mode puts a second model on the same device. On CUDA the
gauge reads whole-device used/total, so a co-tenant process counts too.

1. `curl -s localhost:8002/readyz | jq '{capacity_used, capacity_max}'`
   on each replica — is the fleet simply oversubscribed?
2. Drain conversation sessions first: they hold ~2× the resources of a
   dictation session. Setting `MDX_CONVERSATION_ENABLED=false` on a
   worker makes it advertise zero conversation capacity at the next
   restart without touching dictation.
3. If memory is high with FEW sessions, suspect a leak rather than
   load — session teardown should return the gauge to the two-model
   floor (measured: Whisper ≈ 362 MB + diarizer ≈ 164 MB RSS on CPU).

### § verify the baked models

Both models are baked, checksum-pinned, and re-verified at startup. To
confirm what a running image actually contains:

```sh
docker inspect <image> --format '{{json .Config.Labels}}' | jq   # repo/revision/sha256 for both models
docker run --rm --network none <image> \
  python -c "import os;from dictation_service.diarization.integrity import verify_model_dir;\
verify_model_dir(os.environ['MDX_DIAR_MODEL_DIR'],pins={'embedding_model.ckpt':os.environ['MDX_DIAR_MODEL_SHA256'],\
'mean_var_norm_emb.ckpt':os.environ['MDX_DIAR_MEANVAR_SHA256']})"
```

`--network none` is the point: it proves the weights load with no egress.

The build-time HF token is a BuildKit `--secret` and must never reach a
layer. To re-prove that after touching a Dockerfile:

```sh
docker save <image> | grep -a -c '<the token>'   # must print 0
docker history --no-trunc <image> | grep -c '<the token>'  # must print 0
```

### § mass-reconnects

Symptom: `mdx_dictation_reconnects_total` rate > 10% of sessions over 1 h.

Likely causes: load-balancer reload, corporate-proxy update, network
event. Check LB logs; check `mdx_dictation_ws_upgrade_rejections_total{reason}`
for upstream patterns.

### § audio-truncated

Symptom: `dictation.audio.truncated` audit events appearing.

A session ran past the 30-min ring-buffer head; audio file is truncated
to the last 30 min. Transcript for the lost range was already committed
(if it had been finalized). Investigate per user: abusive client?
runaway retransmit storm?

### § token-expiring-storms

Symptom: many sessions receiving `token_expiring` simultaneously.

Likely a Keycloak issue or a synchronised cohort whose tokens minted
together. Check JWKS cache hit ratio (sprint-02 dashboard). If JWKS
fetch is slow, refresh latency grows and sessions hit `token_expired`
before refresh completes.

### § tmpfs-pressure

Symptom: `OSError: No space left on device` in `audio_buffer.tmpfs_write_failed`.

Each session reserves ~115 MB on tmpfs. 4 concurrent = 460 MB. Sprint
16 mounts a dedicated per-pod tmpfs of 2 GB; until then, ensure host
`/run` has > 1 GB free.

### § sessions-stuck-active (capacity leak)

Symptom: `per_tenant_max_active_sessions` is hit while nobody is
dictating; `GET /dictate/sessions` lists sessions that no client owns.

Cause: the abandon timer lives inside the worker process that owns the
session, so a worker that dies (OOM, node drain, crash) takes its timers
with it and leaves every session it held in `active` / `paused` /
`reconnecting` **forever**. Those rows keep counting against the tenant
cap.

The **reaper** (`session/reaper.py`) is the standing fix: every
`MDX_SESSION_REAPER_INTERVAL_S` (default 300 s) it sweeps sessions
untouched for `MDX_SESSION_REAPER_GRACE_S` (default 300 s) and abandons
the ones whose worker's Redis heartbeat has expired. Its only interlock
is that heartbeat — a session paused for an hour on a *healthy* worker
is a candidate every sweep and is never collected.

Triage:

```bash
# What is stranded, and who owned it?
psql -c "SELECT worker_id, status, count(*), min(last_active_at)
         FROM dictation_sessions
         WHERE status IN ('creating','active','paused','reconnecting')
         GROUP BY 1,2 ORDER BY 3 DESC;"
# Is that worker still alive?  (TTL > 0 = alive)
redis-cli TTL mdx:dict:worker:<worker_id>:hb
```

- Reaper collections log `session.reaped` (WARN) and write
  `dictation.session.abandoned` with `reason=reaped_dead_worker`. A
  steady trickle means workers are dying — chase that, not the reaper.
- Nothing being collected while rows pile up: check the sweep is
  running at all (`session.reaper_swept`) and that
  `MDX_SESSION_REAPER_ENABLED` is not false. Cross-tenant enumeration
  goes through the `dictation_tenants_with_stale_sessions` SECURITY
  DEFINER function — without it RLS silently returns zero rows
  and the reaper "succeeds" having done nothing.

## Pre-flight after deploy

- All replicas report `mdx_dictation_model_loaded{model="whisper"} == 1`.
- Replicas intended to serve conversation report
  `mdx_dictation_conversation_ready == 1` **and** log
  `diarization.model_verified` with the expected revision. A replica that
  logged `diarization.warmup_failed` is dictation-only — intentional, but
  it must be a known state, not a surprise.
- `mdx_dictation_capacity_weight_max` matches the intended budget on
  every replica (a mismatched `MDX_PER_WORKER_MAX_SESSIONS` silently
  changes fleet capacity).
- A synthetic latency probe completes under target.
- WS subprotocol negotiation: client offering an unknown subprotocol
  (e.g. `dictation.v0`) receives 400 (verify via dev-tools).
