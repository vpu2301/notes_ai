## Failure modes

### § master-key-missing

The worker refuses to start because `/etc/mdx/master.key` is missing.

1. Confirm volume mount: `docker compose exec asr-worker ls -l /etc/mdx`.
2. If the file is absent in dev, re-create it:
   ```sh
   openssl rand 32 > infra/dev/master.key
   chmod 0400 infra/dev/master.key
   ```
3. In staging/prod a missing master key is a **security incident** —
   page security lead immediately; do not invent a new key.

### § master-key-permissions

Mode is more permissive than 0400. `chmod 0400` the file and restart.
In staging/prod treat as an incident — the file should never have been
group/other-readable.

### § gpu-oom

Symptoms: `mdx_asr_oom_total` increments; jobs land in `failed` with
`error_kind='gpu_oom'`.

1. Identify the offending job via traces (audio_seconds, segments).
2. If a single tenant is sending unusually long audio, reduce beam size:
   set `MD_ASR_BEAM_SIZE=3` and bounce one replica to confirm the
   reduction holds.
3. If the OOM persists with beam_size=3 on a 30-min file, reduce the
   max audio length cap (`MD_ASR_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS`) until we ship
   chunk-streaming inference (sprint 04).

### § model-corruption

Symptoms: `mdx_asr_model_loaded=0`; worker logs "checksum mismatch".

1. Delete the cached weights: `docker compose exec asr-worker rm -rf /root/.cache/huggingface`.
2. Restart the worker.

### § queue-backlog

Symptoms: `mdx_asr_queue_depth > 100` for > 5 m.

1. Scale workers: `docker compose -f base.yml -f dev.yml -f gpu.yml up -d --scale asr-worker=N`.
2. If the upstream rate is sustained, the capacity model is wrong;
   open a follow-up to revise the sprint-16 sizing ADR.

### § minio-outage

Symptoms: jobs queue but don't progress; worker log says
`storage.s3.head_bucket_failed`.

1. Confirm MinIO health: `mc admin info local`.
2. Recover MinIO; jobs resume automatically because they remain in the
   pending-entries list until reclaimed.

### § nvidia-driver-mismatch

Symptoms: container fails to start; `nvidia-container-cli` errors.

1. `nvidia-smi` on the host — should match the CUDA version in the
   `cuda:12.4.1-cudnn-runtime-ubuntu22.04` base image (driver ≥ 535).
2. Upgrade the host driver or downgrade the worker base image (rare).

### § stranded-jobs (worker_lost / queue_lost / retry_exhausted)

Symptoms: jobs stuck in `running` or `queued` long after the recording
could have finished; a tenant hitting `concurrency_exceeded` on upload
with no visible activity (every stranded row burns a slot in
`MD_ASR_PER_TENANT_CONCURRENT_JOBS`).

The worker is the only writer of a job's terminal status, and it cannot
write one for the crash that killed it. Two backstops close that gap —
the DLQ path (`retry_exhausted`) and the reaper in **asr-service**
(`worker_lost` for `running`, `queue_lost` for `queued`). Full vocabulary:
`docs/api/asr-job-errors.md`.

1. Check the reaper is running at all: `asr.job_reaper_swept` in
   asr-service logs, and `MD_ASR_JOB_REAPER_ENABLED` (default true).
2. Check the DLQ: `XLEN mdx.asr.jobs:dlq`. Entries carry
   `x-final-error-kind` — that is the failure that kept repeating.
3. If jobs are being reaped that were merely slow (a reaped job whose
   audio is long), the grace window is too tight. It must exceed
   `MD_ASR_MAX_DURATION_SECONDS × MD_ASR_MAX_INFERENCE_SECONDS_MULTIPLIER`
   plus a redelivery; raise `MD_ASR_JOB_REAPER_RUNNING_GRACE_S`.
4. Reaping is safe to re-run and never overwrites a finished job: the
   update is conditional on the status the sweep scanned.

### § audit-chain-divergence (touching asr.*)

Same procedure as sprint-02 auth audit divergence; ASR kinds are
`asr.audio_uploaded`, `asr.job_queued`, `asr.transcription_*`,
`asr.job_cancelled`, `asr.quota_exceeded`.

## Pre-flight after deployment

- Confirm `mdx_asr_model_loaded == 1` on every replica.
- Submit a known-good fixture via `scripts/dev/asr-smoke.sh` (1-line:
  POST a 5-second WAV; expect status=complete within 60 s).
- Confirm a non-zero `mdx_asr_warmup_seconds` exists per replica.
