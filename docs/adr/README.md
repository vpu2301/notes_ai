# Architecture Decision Records

ADRs capture decisions whose reversal would be expensive — choices about
runtimes, build surfaces, security primitives, and contracts other code
depends on. Casual decisions (file layout inside a service, choice of HTTP
status code for a niche error) do not need ADRs.

Numbering is monotonic and global. Sprint 02 starts at ADR-0006; sprint
03 starts at ADR-0009. Gaps in the sequence (0022–0023, 0026–0028,
0032–0033, 0043–0044) are ADRs that belonged exclusively to the removed
medical vertical; the numbers are retired, not reused.

## Template

# ADR-NNNN — Title

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-NNNN
**Deciders:** <names / roles>

---

## Context

What changed in the world that forces a choice now? What constraints?

## Decision

What we are doing. Be unambiguous.

## Consequences

Positive and negative effects. Be honest about the cost.

## Alternatives considered

What we rejected and why.

## Trigger conditions for revisiting

What signal would make us re-open this decision?
```

## Authoring rules

- Number monotonically. Don't reuse a number even after deprecation; mark
  the original as `Superseded by ADR-XXXX` and link forward.
- Keep ADRs short. Two pages is the upper bound. If you need more, the
  decision is several decisions; split.
- Reference the ADR from the affected code (`libs/secret/README.md` →
  ADR-0003). Discoverability matters more than completeness.
