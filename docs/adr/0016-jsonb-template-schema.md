# ADR-0016 — JSONB template schema + cosmetic-vs-structural rule

**Date:** 2026-06-23
**Status:** Accepted
**Deciders:** tech lead, clinical content lead, ML/MLOps lead

## Context

Sprint-06 introduces note templates — the structural definition of
what users dictate (sections, prompts, voice aliases, metadata).
Sprint-8 notes persist `template_id` + `schema_version` at
finalization; later export features emit document structure from
template metadata.

The schema design space:

| Approach          | Schema-change cost | Authoring workflow | Query patterns | Notes |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------- | ----- |
| Relational (one table per field type) | high (migrations) | content team needs DBA help | strong | rigid |
| Star schema (template + sections tables) | medium | OK | strong | every section is a row → 16 templates × 5-8 sections = 80-128 rows; admin UI is harder |
| JSONB (one document per template version) | low (Pydantic at boundaries) | YAML/JSON authoring | weaker (need ->>) | fast iteration |
| Document store (Mongo) | low | OK | weak | adds infra |

## Decision

**JSONB** for the template definition. The schema is validated by
`libs/template_models.TemplateDefinition` (Pydantic, `extra="forbid"`)
at every boundary that touches it (HTTP POST/PUT, seed loader, CI gate).

Cosmetic edits update the row in place and bump `schema_version`.
Structural edits insert a new row with `parent_template_id` set and
`schema_version = 1`.

**Cosmetic** = name, voice_aliases, asr_prompt, order, default_content,
metadata (non-FHIR fields).

**Structural** = section added/removed, `field_type` changed, `required`
flipped, `min_chars` increased.

## Why this distinction matters

Sprint-8 notes reference templates by ID. If a content edit
removes a section that 1,000 existing notes populated, those notes
must remain readable as-they-were. Forcing structural changes to create
a new row preserves the lineage; existing notes point at the old row.

If we'd let a cosmetic edit silently change the section list, sprint-8
notes would suddenly have an "orphan section" (data without a
home in the template) and a missing section (template field with no
data). Content leads would discover this only when a
user notices their note layout broke.

## Consequences

- **Authoring workflow**: the content lead edits a JSON file, runs
  `make seed`, and the seed function `upsert_system_template`
  takes care of either cosmetic update (in place, version bump) or
  structural new-row. The 16 sprint-06 templates pass validation in
  CI on every PR.
- **Query patterns**: list endpoint reads metadata columns only (fast).
  Detail endpoint reads JSONB (slower; cached in-process for 60 s).
- **Sprint-8 reports** persist both `template_id` and
  `template_version`; the diff endpoint surfaces template-shape
  differences as `metadata_changes`. The FK is `ON DELETE RESTRICT`
  (templates are soft-deleted, never hard-deleted).
- **Sprint-17 FHIR**: emits Composition.section structure from
  template.metadata.fhir_template; cosmetic edits don't break the
  mapping; structural edits emit a new Composition profile linked to
  the new template version.

## Alternatives considered

- **Star schema (template + sections tables)**: rejected — admin UI
  to edit a section becomes "edit a row in another table", which is
  harder to wire than a JSON form. Versioning is also harder: a
  structural change requires creating new rows in both tables.
- **Document store**: rejected — adds a new dependency for a small
  amount of data (16 templates per tenant × ~30 tenants = 500 rows
  is well within Postgres + JSONB scale).

## Migration path off JSONB

If sprint-17+ admin UI demands richer query patterns (e.g., "show me
every template that mentions BP normalization"), we can introduce
materialized views over JSONB. If that's not enough, we re-shape into
a star schema with a one-shot migration; the Pydantic boundary stays
the same.

## Trigger conditions for revisiting

- JSONB query patterns becoming a bottleneck (unlikely; even at
  10× current scale, JSONB + GIN is fine).
- Clinical content team wants in-app authoring (sprint-17 nice-to-have);
  doesn't change the schema decision.

## Amendment (2026-06-23) — `SwitchSection` is v1-additive

The `dictation.v1` protocol gains a `SwitchSection` client
message. Sprint-04 ADR-0012 reserved subprotocol version bumps for
breaking changes; `SwitchSection` is **additive**:

- v1 clients that never send `SwitchSection` are unaffected.
- v1 servers accept the new message because the discriminated union
  was extended in-place (Pydantic's discriminator routes to the new
  type when `type == "switch_section"`; otherwise the union behaves
  exactly as before).
- `extra="forbid"` on every message means a future v2-additive field
  on `SwitchSection` would be rejected by v1 servers — which is the
  correct semantics: a v2 client must connect with `dictation.v2`
  to use v2-additive fields.

No subprotocol bump. Documented in `docs/api/dictation-ws-v1.md`.

## Amendment (2026-07-22, sprint 13) — `choice`/`multi_choice` + the options edit matrix

Sprint 13 extends `FieldType` with `choice` and `multi_choice` and adds
`TemplateSection.options: tuple[ChoiceOption, ...]`
(`{value, label, voice_aliases}`; required 2..50 for the choice kinds,
forbidden otherwise).

**Two ADR-0016 facts, kept distinct:**

1. **Adding enum values is additive to the *model*.** Every pre-S13
   template validates unchanged and serializes **byte-identically**
   (`options` is omitted from dumps when empty via a model serializer;
   the additive proof test in `libs/template_models` compares all 20
   pre-S13 seed templates against frozen pre-bump dumps).
2. **Changing an existing section's `field_type` remains STRUCTURAL**,
   including transitions to/from/between the new types — a new template
   row, as before.

**Options edit classification** (extends the cosmetic/structural rule):

| Edit | Kind | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Add an option | cosmetic | existing reports' stored `value`s stay valid |
| Add/change an option's `voice_aliases` | cosmetic | extraction fuel only; no stored data references aliases |
| Change an option's `label` only | cosmetic | `value` is the stored identity; label is presentation |
| Remove an option `value` | **structural** | reports persisted the `value` in `field_specific_metadata`; it would dangle |
| Rename an option `value` | **structural** | indistinguishable from remove+add of the stable identity |

`ChoiceOption.value` is therefore the same kind of contract as
`TemplateSection.id`: a stable identifier that stored report content
references. The classifier detects removals/renames as
"option values removed/renamed" reasons.

Option `voice_aliases` are normalized at validation (NFC, lower-case,
stripped) so the sprint-13 extractor matches against canonical forms
without re-normalizing template data, and must be unique across a
section's options — an ambiguous alias would force the extractor to
guess, which it never does.
