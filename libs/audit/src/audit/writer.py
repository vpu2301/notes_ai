"""``AuditWriter`` — the single sanctioned path for emitting audit events.

Contract:

- Acquires a connection from the audit_writer pool (passed in by the caller,
  distinct from the app_role pool).
- Wraps each write in a READ COMMITTED transaction.
- ``SET LOCAL app.tenant_id`` so RLS policies match.
- ``SELECT seq, payload_hash FROM audit.events WHERE tenant_id = $1 ORDER BY
  seq DESC LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE`` — the FOR UPDATE row lock is the actual
  serialisation primitive: a second writer for the same tenant blocks until
  the first commits, then re-reads the latest ``last_seq`` (READ COMMITTED
  semantics on a row lock).
- Builds the event_record dict (with ``tenant_id``, ``seq``, ``created_at``,
  actor + kind + target + the caller-supplied payload), JCS-canonicalises it,
  computes ``payload_hash = sha256(prev_hash || jcs_bytes)``, and INSERTs.
- Genesis row (seq=1) has ``prev_hash`` as 32 zero bytes.
- Retries on serialization failure or primary-key conflict up to 3 times
  with exponential backoff. Under normal load these never fire — they are
  defensive in case of unexpected contention modes (e.g. logical replication
  lag, statement timeouts).

Why not SERIALIZABLE? The spec calls for it but with the per-tenant row
lock from FOR UPDATE, the additional anomaly checks SERIALIZABLE provides
become *additional contention* (pivot-anomaly retries) under high write
fan-out. READ COMMITTED + FOR UPDATE gives the same correctness for the
"strict per-tenant monotonic seq" invariant without those retries.
