"""``AuditVerifier`` — replay a tenant's audit chain and surface tampering.

Algorithm:

1. Acquire a connection from the audit_reader pool.
2. ``SET LOCAL app.tenant_id`` so RLS restricts the walk to one tenant.
3. ``SELECT seq, payload_jcs, prev_hash, payload_hash FROM audit.events
   WHERE tenant_id = $1 AND seq BETWEEN $2 AND $3 ORDER BY seq`` — pulls
   the entire requested range in one query (the verifier is meant to be
   batch / nightly; for very long chains, the caller chunks via from_seq /
   to_seq).
4. Walk the rows. At each row, the *expected* ``payload_hash`` is
   ``sha256(running || jcs(payload_jcs))``. The first row's expected
   ``prev_hash`` is the genesis (32 zero bytes); each subsequent row's
   expected ``prev_hash`` is the previous row's stored ``payload_hash``.
5. On any mismatch — wrong prev_hash, wrong payload_hash, or a gap in seq
   numbers — return a ``VerificationReport`` describing the first
   divergence and stop. The chain is "ok" only when every row in the
   range verifies.

Divergence reasons:

- ``gap``  — seq numbers are not consecutive (e.g. 1, 2, 4 means seq=3 is
             missing and we report at seq=4 with reason gap).
- ``prev_hash_mismatch`` — the row's stored ``prev_hash`` doesn't match
             the previous row's stored ``payload_hash``.
- ``payload_hash_mismatch`` — the recomputed hash differs from stored
             ``payload_hash`` (the payload_jcs has been tampered with).

The verifier itself never modifies state.
