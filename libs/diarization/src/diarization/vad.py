"""Silero VAD segmentation tuned for diarization (sprint 14).

Distinct from ``asr_worker.vad`` on purpose: that wrapper merges segments
< 500 ms apart and caps them at 30 s for Whisper's context window — both
transformations destroy speaker-turn boundaries. Here we keep turns as
Silero reports them (250 ms min silence splits a speaker hand-off
into two segments) and never merge across a potential turn change.

Fail-loud policy: diarization with a stubbed VAD would silently produce
garbage speaker labels on real meetings, so unlike the asr-worker
wrapper there is NO stub fallback — a missing silero-vad install raises
at load time and diarization is refused (non-diarized work is
unaffected; it never loads this module).
