"""Strict claims model. ``extra="forbid"`` is the defining contract.

If a token arrives with a claim we don't recognise — e.g. an attacker tries
to inject ``is_admin: true`` — Pydantic raises and ``MalformedClaimsError``
fires. That guarantees no service can be tricked by a claim it doesn't know
to check.

**Deviation from the sprint-02 spec.** The spec lists only the
security-bearing fields (``sub``, ``tid``, ``roles``, ``scope``, ``mfa``,
``sid``, ``iss``, ``aud``, ``exp``, ``iat``, ``nbf``). In practice Keycloak
always emits a handful of standard JOSE/OIDC fields that we don't act on
(``jti``, ``typ``, ``azp``, ``auth_time``, ``acr``, ``session_state``,
``allowed-origins``, plus profile/email-scope fields). We enumerate those
explicitly as Optional defaults so the allowlist remains explicit and
unknown claims still raise — preserving the spec's defence against
``is_admin``-style injection while not fighting the IdP.
