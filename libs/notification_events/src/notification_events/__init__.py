"""Notification event contract.

Shared by producers (note-service, auth-service, background jobs) and
the notification-service consumer so there is exactly one definition
of the envelope on the wire — the ``libs/asr_models`` pattern from
sprint 04.

This is a LEAF package: pure Pydantic types, no other internal lib.

Reordering or renaming a field is a BREAKING change. Bump to a
``notification_events`` v2 module and run both for a deprecation window
rather than editing in place — the same discipline the WebSocket
protocol version carries.
