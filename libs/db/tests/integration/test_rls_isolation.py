"""RLS isolation property test against the real `users` table.

Sprint-02 Day 3 contract: with RLS enabled+forced and per-tenant policies,
no `app_role` connection can ever see another tenant's rows, regardless of
how the data is laid out.

Hypothesis drives the *shape* of the setup (how many tenants, how many
users per tenant). For each generated shape we:

1. Pre-populate users for every tenant via `tenant_writer`.
2. Re-open the pool as `app_role` and SELECT from each tenant's context.
3. Assert each tenant sees exactly its own user count and no other.
4. Cross-probe: under tenant A's context, attempt to read user rows that
   exist for tenant B → must return zero rows.

The total cross-tenant probes across all Hypothesis examples must reach
the spec's threshold of 1000 iterations. With 20 examples × an N×N
all-pairs probe (N up to 8) we hit ~1000+ easily.

Skipped unless ``RUN_DB_INTEGRATION=1`` and the dev Compose stack is up
with migrations applied (``make migrate-up``).
