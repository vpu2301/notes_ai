"""CI gate — primitives from ``cryptography`` must live in libs/crypto.

Sprint 03 introduces ``libs/crypto`` as the only sanctioned envelope
path. Direct use of ``cryptography.hazmat.primitives`` elsewhere in the
codebase is a red flag — it usually means an engineer has reinvented
encryption or bypassed the envelope.

Allow-listed paths: libs/crypto/, tests/ (so adversarial tests can
construct deliberately-bad ciphertext to verify the envelope rejects it),
and libs/kep/ — the KEP digital-signature library (sprint 09). KEP signing
operates on X.509 certificate chains and CMS/PAdES structures, a domain the
``libs/crypto`` AEAD envelope abstraction does not (and should not) cover, so
libs/kep is a second sanctioned home for ``cryptography`` primitives.

Exit codes:
    0 — no violations
    1 — violations printed to stderr
